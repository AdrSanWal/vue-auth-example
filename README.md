# vue-auth-example

This is a project to practice vue authentication.

Para ello he utilizado la api alojada en https://dummyjson.com/
Por lo que las operaciones realizadas no tienen persistencia.

I'm not a professional programmer and everything here has been done from scratch and researched on my own, so if you see something that could be improved, let me know. All constructive criticism is welcome.
